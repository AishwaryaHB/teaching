Teaching has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my academic career so far, and I've had the opportunity to contribute to multiple great courses over time, mostly in the capacity of a teaching assistant. I've also been lucky enough to have the chance to work with and mentor a few undergraduate students conducting research in the NerDS lab. 

### Teaching Assistant
#### Semester-long courses:
- **Fall 2019**: COE 3803 - Data Analytics for Engineers
- **Fall 2018**: COE 3803 - Data Analytics for Engineers

In addition to carrying out the usual TA responsibilities of holding office hours, grading homework, etc. I was actively involved in the development of the course material and running of COE 3803 by virtue of it being a new course taught by my advisor, <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Eva Dyer</a> and <a href="http://chbe.gatech.edu/people/andrew-j-medford" target="_blank">Dr. A.J. Medford</a>!
- **Spring 2018**: ECE 4813 - Mathematical Foundations of Data Science

MFDS was a new, special topics course taught by <a href="https://u.osu.edu/kiryung/" target="_blank">Dr. Kiryung Lee</a> which introduced senior undergraduates to a number of foundational topics in machine learning and data science. I was the sole TA for the class and had the responsibility of grading homework and conducting (some of my most popular and appreciated) office hours.

#### Workshops and short courses
- **June 2019**: Hands-On Tech Day Camp, GaTech. [<a href="https://github.com/nerdslab/HandsOnTech" target="_blank">Github repository</a>]

The <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/hot-days#:~:text=The%20H.O.T.,graduates%20majoring%20in%20this%20field." target="blank">H.O.T. Days @ Georgia Tech camp</a> is a one-week-long summer day camp designed to introduce students attending high schools in Georgia to electrical and computer engineering (ECE) concepts. Under <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank"> Dr. Eva Dyer</a> & <a href="http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>, I had the opportunity to introduce ~40 rising high school juniors/seniors to image processing, convolutional neural networks, and style transfer.
- **May 2019**: Deep Learning for Microscopy Image Analysis, Marine Biological Laboratory
