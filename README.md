### Teaching Assistant

Teaching has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my academic career so far, and I've had the opportunity to contribute to multiple great courses in the capactity of a teaching assistant as a graduate student at GaTech. In addition to carrying out the usual TA responsibilities of holding office hours, grading homework, etc. I was actively involved in the development of the course material and running of COE 3803 by virtue of it being a new course taught by my advisor!

- **Fall 2019**: COE 3803: Data Analytics for Engineers (under Dr. Eva Dyer & Dr. A.J. Medford)
- **Fall 2018**: COE 3803: Data Analytics for Engineers (under Dr. Eva Dyer & Dr. A.J. Medford)
- **Spring 2018**: ECE 4813: Mathematical Foundations of Data Science (under Dr. Kiryung Lee, now at Ohio State)
