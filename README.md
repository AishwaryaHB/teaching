### Teaching and Mentoring Experience

I've been lucky to have had the opportunity to teach, mentor, and work with a number of smart and motivated students. Quite a few of these opporunities presented themselves as TAships that I've held over the years while others have come in the form of collaborations that I've had with fellow students conducting research in the <a href="http://dyerlab.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">NerDS lab</a>.

### Teaching Assistant
#### Semester-long courses:
- Fall 2019, 2018: __Data Analytics for Engineers__ (COE 3803)

DAE was an interdisciplinary, introductory machine learning and data science class aimed at undergraduate juniors and seniors across the <a href="https://coe.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering</a> at GaTech. In addition to carrying out the usual TA responsibilities of holding office hours, grading homework, etc. I was also actively involved in the development of the course material and running of DAE by virtue of it being a new course taught by my (former) advisor <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Eva Dyer</a> along with <a href="http://chbe.gatech.edu/people/andrew-j-medford" target="_blank">Dr. A.J. Medford</a>!
- Spring 2018: __Mathematical Foundations of Data Science__ (ECE 4813)

MFDS was a new, special topics course taught by <a href="https://u.osu.edu/kiryung/" target="_blank">Dr. Kiryung Lee</a> which introduced senior ECE undergraduates to a number of foundational topics in machine learning and data science. I was the sole TA for the class and had the responsibility of grading homework and conducting (some of my most popular and appreciated) office hours.

#### Workshops and short courses
- June 2019: __Hands-On Tech Day Camp__, GaTech. [<a href="https://github.com/nerdslab/HandsOnTech" target="_blank">Github repository</a>]

<a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/hot-days#:~:text=The%20H.O.T.,graduates%20majoring%20in%20this%20field." target="blank">H.O.T. Days @ Georgia Tech</a> is a one-week-long summer day camp designed to expose students attending high schools in Georgia to electrical and computer engineering (ECE) concepts and their various applications. Under <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank"> Dr. Eva Dyer</a> & <a href="http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>, I had the opportunity to introduce ~40 rising high school juniors/seniors to image processing, convolutional neural networks, and style transfer.

- May 2019: __Deep Learning for Microscopy Image Analysis__, Marine Biological Laboratory

<a href="https://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/deep-learning-for-microscopy-image-analysis/" target="_blank">DL@MBL</a> is a short summer course meant to familiarize researchers in the life sciences with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, tools, and frameworks that could be used to solve problems involving microscopy image analysis in their research. I was happy to accompany <a href="https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Eva-Dyer" target="_blank">Dr. Dyer</a> (who was a course faculty member) as one of her TAs in 2019, and worked with the attendees during labs covering topics ranging from introductory image processing to advanced deep learning models for image denoising, segmentation and classification. I also had the chance to eat some great sea food and tour the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/" target="_blank">Marine Biological Lab</a> + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">Woods Hole</a> during my visit!

### Junior Instructor
- June/July 2016: __Embedded Systems and IoT__, Eduvance.

I had the opportunity to serve as one of the junior instructors for the Summer 2016 offering of <a href="https://www.eduvance.in/mbed/" target="_blank">Summer Industrial Training and Internship Program in Embedded Systems and IoT</a>, a month long course conducted by <a href="https://www.eduvance.in/" target="_blank">Eduvance</a> in collaboration with the ARM University Program, Cypress University Alliance, and Microchip Technologies. The course introduced rising seniors pursuing ECE and other related majors to embedded systems in both theory and practice with the intention of making them better prepared to execute their senior design projects.

### Mentees
- **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-miano-a5b91785/" target="_blank">Joseph Miano</a>**: During his time as an undergrad at GT, Joe and I collaborated on a project dealing with multi-scale representation learning of X-ray microtomogrphy data. Our work together eventually led to two papers (in preparation - one journal and one conference), and an extended abstract that was presented at <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/events-training/bioimage-informatics-2019/" target="_blank">BioImage Informatics 2019</a>.
